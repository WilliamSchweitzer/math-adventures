- point reflection is equal to the differnce between two points times 2
- so dx = px - qx
- dy = py - qy
- so the reflection is just that times two
- reflection he 2*(dx)
- However, if you want to reflect over the x/y axis then you must then subtract px/py
- resulting in differing values say rx/ry = reflected points
- rx = 2dx - qx
- ry = 2dy - qy
