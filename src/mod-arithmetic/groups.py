# Learning about groups in modular arithmetic

"""
Prime number:
 - A positive integer greater than 1
 - it's gcd is 1, and itself

 30 of the smallest prime numbers:
 2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113
 
 The spacing increases greatly as prime numbers increase.

 Group:
 Example: integers from 0-9 and addition modulo 10
 - closed
 - have an identity
 - are invertible
 - are assosiative
"""

"""
Additional notes:
 Consider p = 13 (0-12)
 Consider generator 7
 g = 7 is a generator because it covers all #'s from 0-12
 When g^n mod p = result
 When n goes from 0->inf, the results will cover all possible values of prime p
